GPUs in the cloud are now available for free or at low cost for small computations.

If you have a mobile web browser [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/gpu.ipynb) offers free GPU enabled Linux containers for anyone with a Google login. For $10 a month they offer expanded access to higher performance GPU and TPU units.

[AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) now offers GPU instances with 32 cores and 244G RAM for $0.65/min, and non-GPU instances with 72 cores and 144G RAM for $0.20/min.

One of the barriers for GPU programming is access to hardware and getting it set up 
properly. If you donâ€™t have local hardware available, you can try out some free 
trial ($200-300 credit) cloud services that set up an HPC cluster with Nvidia GPUs at Fluid Numerics Google Cloud Platform.

For testing out Intel GPUs, Intel has set up cloud services for trial services.
